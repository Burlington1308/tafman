                <h2>What happens if my exterior paint is peeling and cracking?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is time to repaint, depending on the severity of the peeling paint 
                    and cracking paint. The longer paint is left to peel and crack the more 
                    chances the unpainted wood may deteriorate, and need replaced. Most 
                    damage is hidden from view behind the lose paint and continues to worsen 
                    with the length of time it is left untreated. You should consult a 
                    professional painter to evaluate your home’s exterior painting needs.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Should I do the prep work myself before the painter comes to my home?</h2>
                <p>
                    No, it is not necessary, when your painter estimates your home, he will factor 
                    all of the painting prep work needed. Unless you have experience in the field, 
                    it is best left to the professional painter you have hired. The prep work does 
                    change your bid somewhat, but the cost you save yourself, from having to repair 
                    or replace a second time, is well worth it.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>I need a house painting estimate on a weekend is that a problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    No problem we have weekend and evening painting appointments available.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How Long Does Interior Paint Last?</h2>
                <p>
                    With proper preparation and quality products, interior paint can last 5–10 years.
                    However, high-traffic areas such as hallways, kitchens, and bathrooms may need touch-ups sooner. 
                    Bedrooms and ceilings typically last longer.
